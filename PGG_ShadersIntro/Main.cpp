	// We need to do this through SDL, so that it can set up the OpenGL drawing context that matches this
	// (of course in reality we have no guarantee this will be available and should provide fallback methods if it's not!)
	// Anyway, we basically first say which version of OpenGL we want to use
	// So let's say 4.3:
	// Major version number (4):
	SDL_GL_SetAttribute( SDL_GL_CONTEXT_MAJOR_VERSION, 4 );
	// Minor version number (3):
